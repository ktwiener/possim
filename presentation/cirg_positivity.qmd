## 

We can target different parameters of interest in causal inference, including the average treatment effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect in the treated (ATT)

-   The "identification conditions" of causal consistency, exchangeability, and positivity are sufficient to point-identify the ATE. @hernán2006

This presentation will:

1.  Describe conditions sufficient to point-identity the ATE and the ATT.

2.  Provide an example where the ATE and ATT differ.

3.  Demonstrate a simulation study where we vary the identification conditions.

## Identification conditions

$A =$ treatment (1: treated, 0: untreated), $W =$ set of measured confounders, $Y^{a} =$ potential outcome under treatment $A=a$

### Average treatment effect (ATE)

1.  Causal consistency: If $A_i = a, Y_i = Y_i^a$
2.  Conditional exchangeability: $Y^a⊥A|W$
3.  Positivity: $Pr(A=a|W=w)>0$, for all $w$ where $f(w)>0$

### Average treatment effect in the treated (ATT)

1.  Causal consistency: If $A_i = a, Y_i = Y_i^a$
2.  Partial conditional exchangeability: $Y^{a=0}⊥A|W$
3.  Partial positivity: $Pr(A=a|W=w)>0$, for all $w$ where $f(w|A=1)>0$

## Motivating example

**Results of Multivariable Logistic Regression, Propensity Matching, Propensity Adjustment, and Propensity-based Weighting under Conditions of Nonuniform Effect @kurth2006**

*Tobias Kurth, Alexander M. Walker, Robert J. Glynn, K. Arnold Chan, J.Michael Gaziano, Klaus Berger, and James M. Robins*

-   Investigated the effect of tissue-type plasminogen activator therapy (tPA) on in-hospital mortality in ischemic stroke patients.

-   Utilized the Stroke Registry of Northwest Germany, 2000-2001

-   Compared 5 methods of treatment effect estimation

## Motivating example

To motivate our simulation, we updated Kurth and colleagues' analyses using 2020-2021 data from the same stroke registry.

We made a few updates:

1.  Focused on risk ratios
2.  Only two methods: inverse probability of treatment and standardized mortality ratio weighted effect estimates.
3.  Propensity score model coefficients, weighted risks, risk ratios, odds ratios, and corresponding standard errors estimated using M-estimation.

: Comparison of estimated treatment effect of tPA on in-hospital mortality using IPT and SMR weighted risk ratios

## Simulation

-   We define three populations, each with a treatment ($A$) prevalence of 0.2.

-   Each population has a different prevalence of confounder $W$: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75

-   Treatment assignment:

    -   Under "complete" conditional exchangeability with positivity, the prevalence of treatment does not depend on W.

    -   Under "partial" conditional exchangeability with positivity for the treated, prevalence of treatment does depend on W, i.e.: $$ P(A=1|W=0) = 0 $$ $$ P(A=1|W=1) = 0.8, 0.4, 0.267 $$

## Simulation

-   Generated potential outcomes under each treatment strategy assuming a treatment effect corresponding to a risk ratio of 0.8.
    -   Outcome incidence in the untreated ranged from 0.01 (W=0) to 0.08 (W=1).
-   Propensity score model coefficients, weighted risks, risk ratios, odds ratios, and corresponding standard errors estimated using M-estimation.

## Simulation Results

## Conclusions

-   The effect of tPA on in-hospital mortality continues to show considerable treatment effect heterogeneity.

-   Targeting the ATE when causal identification conditions are not met results in biased effect estimates.

-   If partial causal identification conditions are met for one treatment group, the treatment effect for that group can be consistently estimated.

### Still working on:

-   Understanding discrepancies by weighted risk estimators (Hajek vs. Horvitz-Thompson)

-   Running all 5,000 simulations
