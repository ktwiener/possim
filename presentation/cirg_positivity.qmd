## 

The average treatment effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect in the treated (ATT) are oft-targeted parameters of interest in causal inference.

**This presentation will:**

1.  Provide an example where the ATE and ATT differ.

2.  Describe conditions sufficient to point-identity the ATE and the ATT.

3.  Demonstrate a simulation study where we vary the identification conditions.

## Motivation: tPA effect heterogeneity

## Kurth et al. (2006) Background

\vspace{0.5cm}

**Investigated the effect of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy on in-hospital ischemic stroke mortality**

-   tPA is the gold standard for ischemic stroke patients \vspace{0.25cm}
-   Often contraindicated

**Data source**

-   The Stroke Registry of Northwest Germany (2000 - 2001) \vspace{0.25cm}

## 2006: Analysis

**Compared 5 methods of treatment effect estimation**

1.  Multivariable logistic regression adjustment

2.  PS matching

3.  PS regression adjustment

4.  IPTW

5.  SMR weights

Bootstrapped for (weighted) standard error estimates.

## 2006 Results: Propensity Scores

## 2006: Conclusion

-   Low propensity patients different from others wrt death under treatment. \vspace{0.5cm}
-   Treatment effects are sensitive to the (implicit or explicit) weighting system in the presence of hetereogeneity. \vspace{0.5cm}
    -   And answer different questions.

## Motivating Example: 2024 (in-progress)

We updated the analysis using 2020-2021 data from the same stroke registry.

Updates:

1.  Focused on risk ratios \vspace{0.25cm}
2.  SMR & IPT weighted effect estimates. \vspace{0.25cm}
3.  Utilized M-estimation. (WHY?)

## 2024 Analysis

-   Estimated propensity score using logistic regression. \vspace{0.25cm}
    -   *Some changes to variables.* \vspace{0.5cm}
-   IPT weights to target ATE \vspace{0.5cm}
-   SMR weights to target ATT \vspace{0.5cm}
-   Hajek & Horvitz Thompson estimators for the IPT weighted risks.

: Estimated treatment effect of tPA on in-hospital stroke mortality

## 2024 Conclusions

-   Effect of tPA on in-hospital mortality shows considerable treatment effect heterogeneity. \vspace{0.5cm} \vspace{0.5cm}
-   The effect estimate targeting the ATE indicates tPA harm \vspace{0.5cm}
-   The effect estimate targeting the ATT indicates tPA benefit \vspace{0.5cm}

What's the right question?

What's identifiable?

## Identification conditions

$A =$ treatment (1: treated, 0: untreated), $W =$ set of measured confounders, $Y^{a} =$ potential outcome under treatment $A=a$

### Average treatment effect (ATE) @hernán2006

1.  Causal consistency: If $A_i = a, Y_i = Y_i^a$
2.  Conditional exchangeability: \textcolor{red}{$Y^a⊥A|W$}
3.  Positivity: $Pr(A=a|W=w)>0$, for all $w$ where \textcolor{red}{$f(w)>0$}

### Average treatment effect in the treated (ATT)

1.  Causal consistency: If $A_i = a, Y_i = Y_i^a$
2.  Partial conditional exchangeability: \textcolor{red}{$Y^{a=0}⊥A|W$}
3.  Partial positivity: $Pr(A=a|W=w)>0$, for all $w$ where \textcolor{red}{$f(w|A=1)>0$}

## Simulation

-   Three populations, with confounder $W$ prevalence: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 \vspace{0.25cm}
-   Treatment assignment scenarios (marginal 0.2): \vspace{0.25cm}
    -   Complete positivity: $$0 < P(A=1|W=w) < 1$$ \vspace{0.25cm}
    -   Partial positivity (in treated): $$0 < P(A=1|W=1) < 1$$ $$P(A=1|W=0) = 0$$

## Simulation

-   Treatment effect: risk ratio of 0.8. \vspace{0.25cm}
-   Untreated outcome incidence 0.01 (W=0) to 0.08 (W=1). \vspace{0.25cm}
-   Estimated the ATE and ATT.
    -   Hajek and Horvitz-Thompson estimators for the ATE
    -   *Why?* \vspace{0.25cm}
-   Utilized M-estimation \vspace{0.25cm}
-   Simulation performance measures: bias, ASE, ESE, MSE, 95% CI coverage

## Simulation Results (Hajek)

## Simulation Results (Horvitz-Thompson)

## Conclusions

-   Targeting the ATE when causal identification conditions are not met results in biased effect estimates. \vspace{0.25cm}
-   The direction and magnitude of the bias depends on the selected IPT weighted estimator. \vspace{0.25cm}
-   If partial causal identification conditions are met in one group, can consistently estimate the treatment effect for that group.

### Still working on:

-   Articulating discrepancies by weighted risk estimators (Hajek vs. Horvitz-Thompson)

-   Running all 5,000 simulations
